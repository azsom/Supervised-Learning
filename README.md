# Supervised-Learning, an AI+Training course series

Supervised Learning is a course series that walks through all steps of the classical supervised machine learning pipeline. We use python and packages like scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. The course series focuses on topics like cross validation and splitting strategies, evaluation metrics, supervised machine learning algorithms (like linear and logistic regression, support vector machines, and tree-based methods like random forest, gradient boosting, and XGBoost), and interpretability. You can complete the courses in sequence or complete individual courses based on your interest.
